# Symptoms Based Disease Prediction.
Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning
The patient can fill up to 5 symptoms and based on these symptoms Machine Learning will predict disease. 
It predicts disease by using three different machine learning algorithms.
*	Random Forest
* Decision Tree
* Na√Øve Bayes
The output is accurate.
It uses tkinter for GUI and Numpy, Pandas for data mining

# 1. Project Scope  
This Machine Learning project is used to predict the disease based on the symptoms given by the user. So, the output is accurate. 
The system allows the patient to give symptoms and according to those symptoms the system will predict a disease. 

# 2. Technology Used
* Tkinter for GUI 
* Numpy
* Pandas

# 3. Data collection 
Symptoms data of the diseases are collected from Kaggle.com. 
Real symptoms of the disease are collected i.e. no dummy values are entered.
The csv file contains rows of records of the patients with their symptoms and their corresponding diseases.
